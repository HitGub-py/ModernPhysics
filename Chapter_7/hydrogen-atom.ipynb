    "# The Hydrogen Atom and Atomic Physics\n",
    "The hydrogen atom is the simplest, containing a single electron and proton, and has been the object of more experimentation (and study) than any other atom.  The hydrogen atom has been studied using the Bohr model to better predict spectral absorption and emission lines.  We can now apply the Schr&ouml;dinger equation to the hydrogen atom and further develop quantum mechanics using a real system.  This requires a statistical interpretation of nature (at least for the very small) and the use of quantum numbers that are needed to explain experimental results.\n"

    "It is perhaps surprising that the total energy of the electron does not depend on the angular momentum.  However, a similar result appears in the solution for planetary motion.  A planet's energy depends solely on the semimajor axis and not on its orbital eccentricity.  This occurs because the gravitational and electrostatic forces act from central bodies and the force laws have an inverse-square dependence on distance.\n",

For example for an $n= 3$ state, the energy is the same for all possible values of $\\ell$ (i.e., $\\ell = 0,\\ 1,\\ 2$).  It is customary (especially in chemistry) to use letter names for the various $\\ell$ values.  These are\n",
