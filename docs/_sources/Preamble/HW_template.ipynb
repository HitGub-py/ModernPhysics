    "\n",
    "All homework assignments will be completed using [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) notebooks, where you will submit your source file (\\*.ipynb) and a compiled file (\\*.pdf).  The filename for each submission will be in the following format \"PHYS2700_Chpt#_LastName\", where the \"#\" character is replaced the appropriate chapter number.  Jupyter notebooks allow you to create code cells in [Python](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/) and non-code cells in [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/).  There are short guides in the Preamble that will help you. \n",
    "\n",
    "A complete homework problem contains a *detailed explanation* that describes the process by which you arrived at the solution.  You will not receive full credit for simply reporting the final answer.  To describe the process, you will use the math mode in $\\LaTeX$ to display equations, numbers in scientific notation, and variables.  A guide to the various commands can be found [here](https://joshua.smcvt.edu/undergradmath/undergradmath.pdf)."

    "## Homework Style\n",

    "The homework assignments should match the following style:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The homework title is the top level section (#).\n",
    "2. Each homework problem is the next level section(##)\n",
    "3. The text following the homework problem is a verbatim copy of the text from the respective problem in **bold**.\n",
    "4. Your detailed explanation is written in normal text, where in-line math mode (single \\$) or display math mode (double \\$) is used appropriately.\n",
    "5. The final result is displayed in **bold**.\n",
    "6. Code cells that recreate your solution are encouraged (but not required) and are placed just after your detailed explanation.\n",

Then the Galilean transformation between the frames is\n",
