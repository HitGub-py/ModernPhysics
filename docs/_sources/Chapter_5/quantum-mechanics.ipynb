    "## X-Ray Scattering\n",
    "R&ouml;ntgen's discovery of x-rays excited efforts to determine the nature and origin of the new *penetrating* radiation. in the early 1900s, [Charles Barkla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Glover_Barkla) discovered that each elements x-rays of characteristic wavelengths and that x-rays exhibit properties of polarization.\n",
    "\n",
    "It became clear that x-rays had wave properties and were a form of EM radiation.  X-ray wavelengths are much shorter than those of visible light, which made it difficult to refract or diffract them like earlier experiments with visible light. Wien and Sommerfeld had estimated the wavelength of an x-ray to be $0.01-0.1\\ {\\rm nm}$.  Knowing the distance between atoms in a crystal ($\\sim 0.1\\ {\\rm nm}$), [Max von Laue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_von_Laue) made the suggestion that x-rays should scatter from the atoms of crystals.  He proposed that if x-rays were a form of EM radiation, then interference effects should be observed.  Furthermore, he identified that crystals might act as three-dimensional gratings that could scatter thew waves and produce the observable interference effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "From the study of optics, we know that wave properties are most easily demonstrated when the sizes of apertures or obstructions are on the same order as the wavelength of light.  We use gratings in optics to separate light by diffraction into different wavelengths.\n",

    "von Laue designed an experiment to perform a test his hypothesis.  He convinced his assistants (Walter Friedrich and Paul Knipping) to perform the measurement.  When they rotated the crystals, the positions and intensities of the diffraction were shown to change.  Though the purposed of von Laue's experiment was to prove the wave nature of x-rays, he demonstrated the lattice structure of crystals too.  The lattice structure of crystals led to the origin of solid-state physics and the development of modern electronics.\n",
    "\n",
    "[William Henry Bragg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Henry_Bragg) and his son, [William Lawrence Bragg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Bragg), fully exploited the wave nature of x-rays and simplified von Laue's analysis.  Bragg (the son) pointed out that each of the images surrounding the bright central spot of von Laue's photographs could be the reflection of the incident x-ray beam from a unique set of atoms within the crystal.  Each dot in the pattern corresponds to different ste of planes in the crystal.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Is x-ray scattering from atoms within crystals consistent with what we know from classical physics?*  From classical EM theory, we know that the oscillating electric field polarizes an atom.  The result is an asymmetric chared distribution, or electric dipole.  An electric dipole that oscillates at same frequency as the incident wave will in turn re-radiate EM radiation at the same frequency in the form of spherical waves.  The spherical waves travel through the crystal, constructively or destructively interfering as the waves pass through different directions in the crystal.\n",
