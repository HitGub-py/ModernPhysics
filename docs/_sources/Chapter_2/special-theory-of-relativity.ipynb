    "# Special Theory of Relativity\n",
    "\n",
    "Albert Einstein presented his special theory of relativity in 1905, which tells us how we should measure the relative motion of bodies at high speed.  Most objects are moving fast enough and thus, the **Newtonian principle of relativity** (or *Galilean invariance*) is an acceptable approximation.  Newton's laws of motion must be measured *relative* to some reference frame, where an **inertial frame** is present if Newton's laws are valid in that frame.  \n",
    "\n",
    "A body moves in a straight line with constant velocity if it is not subject to a net external force (i.e., Newton's first law), where the coordinate system attached to that body defines an inertial frame.  A reference frame moving at a uniform velocity relative to the first system also obeys Newton's laws.  Newton showed that it was not possible to determine absolute motion in space by any experiment, where he used relative motion.  \n",

    "## Need for Ether\n",
    "Thomas Young performed his famous experiments on the interference of light in 1802.  [Augustin Fresnel](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Augustin-Jean-Fresnel) showed a detailed understanding of interference, diffraction, and polarization a decade later.  These discoveries showed that light could behave like a wave and how waves interact with each other.  But, classical physicists \"knew\" that all waves needed a medium to travel, where they proposed the *luminiferous aether* (i.e., ether) as that medium.  The ether had to have a low density that planets could pass through it with no apparent changes in their orbits.  Its elasticity must be strong enough to support incredibly high wave speeds too.\n",
    "\n",
    "Maxwell shoed that the speed of light in different media depends only on the electric and magnetic properties of matter.  In vacuum, the speed of light depends on the permeability $\\mu_o$ and permittivity $\\epsilon_o$ of free space.  The properties of the ether must be consistent with electromagnetic theory, which required only a sensitive enough experiment.  There was a *general consensus* for the concept of ether by 1880.  Maxwell's equation were elegant enough to make testable predictions, including matters concerning the ether.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Suppose we flash a light in a moving system $K^\\prime$ and an observer in system $K^\\prime$ measures the speed of light as $c$**.  We can find the speed measured in system $K$ through the addition of velocities, $c \\pm v$, where $v$ is the relative speed of the two systems.  Maxwell's equations don't differentiate between the two systems, and it was unclear which frame should be taken as the reference.  In the late 19th century, physicists proposed that the preferred inertial reference frame was the one with the ether and the speed of light in that frame was $c$.  No experiment at the time was able to discern the effect due to the relative speed $v$ (i.e., $c\\pm v \\approx c$)."

Albert Michelson built an extremely precise device called an *interferometer*, which measures the phase difference between two light waves.  Michelson used his [interferometer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelson_interferometer) to detect the difference in the speed of light passing through the ether in different directions.

Part of the light will eventually go to the mirror $M_1$ and part of the light will travel to $M_2$. The back of $M$ is partially silvered and part of the light is reflected.  The light is reflected at the mirrors ($M_1$ and $M_2$) and comes back to the partially silvered mirror $M$, where part of the light from each path passes on to observer/detector. The compensator is added at $C$ to make sure both light paths pass through equal thicknesses of glass.  Figure {numref}`{number}<interferometer-anim-fig>` shows the paths the light can take.\n",

    "Michelson's experimental result was so surprising that he was asked by several well-known physicists to repeat it.  Together with Edward Morley, Michelson put together a more sophisticated experiment with more mirrors, some of which were adjustable.  The new experiment had an optical path length of $11\\ {\\rm m}$ from eight round trips.  It was mounted on soapstone that floated on mercury to eliminate vibrations.  Michelson and Morley believed they could detect a fringe shift as small as 0.005 and expected the ether to produce a shift of 0.4.  In 1887, they reported a *null result* (i.e., no effect).  The ether does not seem to exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "The inability to detect the ether was a serious blow to reconciling the invariant form of Maxwell's equations.  Lorentz and FitzGerald suggested (apparently independently) that the Michelson-Morley experiment could be understood if length is contracted by the factor $\\gamma^{-1} = \\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}$ in the direction of motion, where $v$ is the speed.  In this situation, the length $d_2$ will be contracted by the $\\gamma^{-1}$ factor, whereas the length $d_1$ will not.  Applying the factor to Eqn. {eq}`time_diff_1` results in making $\\Delta t = 0$ as determined experimentally by Michelson.  The contraction postulate became known as the *Lorentz-FitzGerald* contraction and was not proven from first principles using Maxwell's equations.  Einstein presented his explanation later, and the true significance of the postulate was understood."

Preparations are underway for a manned spacecraft to visit a planet orbiting [Proxima Centauri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxima_Centauri), which is 4.25 lightyears away.  Due to strict regulations, only 16 years of provisions are available for the crew.

From Earth, we realize that the spacecraft will be moving at a high relative $v$ speed.

We need the inverse transformation, which is obtained simply by exchanging the prime and unprimed quantities (i.e., $T = \\gamma T_o^\\prime$).  The replacement of $v$ to $-v$ is subsumed in the $T_o^\\prime$, for which we already have the value.  As a result, we have \n",

In the rest frame of the neutral pions, the two $\\gamma$ rays exit the reaction in opposite directions.  The experimenters measured the velocity of the $\\gamma$ rays going close ($6^\\circ$) to the forward direction ($0^\\circ$) in the laboratory. The Galilean addition velocities would require the velocity of the $\\gamma$ rays to be: $u = 0.99975c + c = 1.99975c$ (i.e., the velocity of the $\\pi^0$ added to the $\\gamma$ moving at $c$).  \n",
    "\n",
    "The velocity of the $\\pi^0$ rest frame with respect to the laboratory is $v=0.99975c$ and the velocity $u_x^\\prime=c$ describes the velocity of the $\\gamma$ rays in the rest frame of the $\\pi^0$.  Equation {eq}`lorentz_vel` gives the relativistic velocity addition to predict the velocity $u_x$ of the $\\gamma$ rays measured in the laboratory as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ u_x = \\frac{c + 0.99975c}{1+\\frac{(0.99975c)c}{c^2}} = c. $$\n",
    "\n",
    "The $x$ direction is along the path of a $\\gamma$ ray in the forward direction and thus, $u_y = u_y^\\prime = u_z = u_z^\\prime =  0$.  The experimental measurement was accomplished by measuring the time taken for the $\\gamma$ rays to travel between two detectors placed ~30 m apart and was in excellent agreement with the relativistic prediction.  We again have conclusive evidence for the need for the special theory of relativity."

    "## Twin Paradox\n",
    "One of the most interesting topics in relativity is the [twin paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin_paradox).  **Suppose there exists a pair of identical twins, where one twin sets out on a spaceship to study $\\alpha$ Centauri (4.37 ly away).**  The **m**oving twin on the spaceship travels at very high speeds to reach the star and returns within 12 years.  The biological clock of the moving twin on the spaceship ticks more slowly than the **f**ixed twin that remained on Earth.  The paradox allows for these scenarios:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. From the **f**ixed twin's perspective, the moving twin should return having aged less than the fixed twin.\n",
    "2. From the **m**oving twin's perspective, the fixed twin will be the younger.  \n",
    "3. Moreover, one could argue that because nature cannot allow both possibilities, it must be true that symmetry prevails and that the twins will still be the same age.\n",
    "\n",
    "The correct answer is options 1, where the **m**oving twin should return as the younger twin.  According to the **f**ixed twin, the spaceship takes off from Earth and quickly reaches its travel speed of $0.8c$.  The travel time to the star is 5.46 years and the total travel time is 10.92 years.  If the twins were 30 years old on departure, then the **f**ixed twin on Earth would be ~41 years on the spaceship's return.  The travel time to $\\alpha$ Centauri for the **m**oving twin is only $5.46\\sqrt{1-0.8^2}\\ {\\rm yr} = 3.28\\ {\\rm yr}$.  Therefore the **m**oving twin will only be 36.5 years old when returning with respect to the the **f**ixed twin's clock at rest.\n",
    "\n",
    "The important fact here is that the **f**ixed twin's clock is in an inertial system during the entire trip, where the **m**oving twin's clock is not.  The **m**oving twin eventually leaves the original inertial system to slow down and turn around.  The **f**ixed twin feels no additional acceleration during the trip, but the **m**oving twin will feel a positive and negative acceleration to turn around."

    "It is sometimes convenient to represent events on a [spacetime diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacetime_diagram).

    "[Hermann Minkowski](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermann_Minkowski) first used spacetime diagrams in 1908 and are often called **Minkowski diagrams**.  An event specifies 3 spatial coordiantes ($x,\\ y,\\ \\&\\ z$) at a point in time $t$.  this is the origin of the term *fourth dimension* for time.  In our spacetime, we eliminate two spatial dimensions to define two events $A$ and $B$ as ($x_A,\\ ct_A$) and ($x_B,\\ ct_B$), respectively.  The line connecting events A and B is called a **worldline**.  A  light signal launched from the origin ($0,\\ 0$) follows a straight line that at $45^\\circ$ as shown in Figure {numref}`{number}<spacetime-fig>`.  An object moving with a velocity less than $c$ would simply have a different slope ($c/v$).\n",

    "The spacetime diagram relates position and simultaneity of events.  **Suppose two photons are released from the origin, one in the positive $x$ direction and the other in the negative $x$ direction.**  Both photons are moving forward in time (i.e., the future), therefore the $ct$ coordinate will be positive.  How do we know that two events occur simultaneously  Simultaneous events will share the same vertical coordinate $ct$, or a horizontal line connects the two worldlines.  If one event occurs in a moving reference frame, then the two events cannot be simultaneous due to the Lorentz transformation.  Since the $x$ coordinate of each event are different, then the $ct$ of the respective events are not equal either.  Note that a negative $ct$ coordinate denotes an event that occurs in the past.\n",
