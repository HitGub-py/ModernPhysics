    "# Structure of the Atom\n",
    "By the end to the 19th century, most physicists and chemists believed in an atomic theory of matter.  Origins of atomic theory dat back to the Greek philosophers, who imagined atoms to be featureless har spheres.  There are considerable similarities between how physicists addressed their atomic theories in the late 19th century and how elementary particle physicists still search for the underlying structure of the building blocks of matter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Physicists and chemists (in 1900) had three pieces of evidence that the atom was not a fundamental unit:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. There seemed to be many kinds of atoms, each belonging to a distinct chemical element.  Ancient Greeks believed in four types of atoms (e.g., earth, air, water, and fire) that combined to make the matter we observe.  The development of chemistry made it clear that there were at least 70 kinds of atoms.\n",
    "2. Experiments showed that atoms and electromagnetic phenomena were intimately related.  Molecules can be dissociated into their components via electrolysis.  Some atoms form magnetic materials, electrical conductors, or insulators.  All kinds of atoms emit light, where the chemical composition can be analyzed through spectroscopy.\n",
    "3. There was the problem of **valence**: why certain elements combine while others do not and why combined elements vary in proportions by the valences of the atoms.  The characteristics of valence suggested that the forces between the atoms are specific in nature, which hinted at an internal atomic structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to this evidence, there were the discoveries of radioactivity, x-rays, and of the electron, which seemed in conflict with earlier ideas of indivisible and elementary atoms.  These indirect hits that the atom had structure developed into an investigation of the atom and its internal composition.\n",

    "(atomic_models)=\n",
    "## The Atomic Models of Thomson and Rutherford\n",
    "\n",
    "Following J.J. Thomson's discovery of the electron, Thomson and others tried to unravel the mystery of the atomic structure.  Scientists knew that electrons were less massive than atoms and that their number was related to the atomic mass.  The central question was, *\"How are the electrons arranged and where are the positive charges that make the atom electrically neutral?*\n",
    "\n",
    "Thomson proposed a model wherein the positive charges were spread uniformly throughout an atom-sized sphere, with electrons embedded in the uniform background.  His model was likened to the distribution of raisins in plum pudding (see the YouTube video below.)  The arrangement of charges had to be in a stable equilibrium.  \n",

    "allowfullscreen></iframe>\n",
    "\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "In Thomson's view, when the atom was heated the electrons could vibrate about their equilibrium positions, thus producing electromagnetic radiation.  The emission frequencies of this radiation would correlate with visible light, if the sphere of positive charges were $\\sim 10^{-10}\\ {\\rm m}$ in diameter.  This size was known to be the approximate size of an atom.  Thomson was unsuccessful in calculating the light spectrum of hydrogen using his model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The small size of the atoms made it impossible to see directly their internal structure.  To make further progress, a new approach was supplied by [Ernest Rutherford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernest_Rutherford).  Rutherford projected very small particles onto a thin material, some of which collided with atoms and eventually exited at various angles.  Rutherford (assisted by [Hans Geiger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Geiger)) conceived a new technique using the scattering of energetic alpha ($\\alpha$) particles from atoms.  Geiger worked with a young student ([Ernest Marsden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernest_Marsden)) to show that surprisingly many $\\alpha$ particles were scattered from thin gold-leaf targets at backward angles greater than $90^\\circ$.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "Rutherford had already demonstrated that the $\\alpha$ particle is an ionized helium atom.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Rutherford worked on the structure of the atom for several years and was well aware of Thomson's model.  Even though he greatly respected Thomson, Rutherford could see that Thomson's model did not agree with spectroscopy or with Geiger's latest experiment with $\\alpha$ particles.\n",
    "\n",
    "A simple thought experiment posits that a .22-caliber rifle fires a bullet into a thin black box.  If the box contains a homogenous material (e.g., wood or water), then the bullet will pass through the box with little or no deviation in its path.  However, if the box contains a few massive steel ball bearings, then occasionally a bullet will be deflected (ricocheted) backward and this would explain the observations of $\\alpha$ scattering by Geiger and Marsden."
